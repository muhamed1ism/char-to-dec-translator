This program gives you decimal value of key that you pressed

e.g. If you press "Enter" it will display you decimal number of key

This can help you if you can't find decimal value of some key in ASCII table

For me personally it's lot easier to just type some key and get its value 

Than trying to find its value in ASCII table every time
